            "Schizophrenia is characterised by significant impairments in the way reality is perceived and changes in behaviour related to: persistent delusions: the person has fixed beliefs that something is true, despite evidence to the contrary; persistent hallucinations: the person may hear, smell, see, touch, or feel things that are not there; experiences of influence, control or passivity: the experience that one’s feelings, impulses, actions, or thoughts are not generated by oneself, are being placed in one’s mind or withdrawn from one’s mind by others, or that one’s thoughts are being broadcast to others; disorganized thinking, which is often observed as jumbled or irrelevant speech; highly disorganised behaviour e.g.\n",
            "the person does things that appear bizarre or purposeless, or the person has unpredictable or inappropriate emotional responses that interfere with their ability to organise their behaviour; “Negative symptoms” such as very limited speech, restricted experience and expression of emotions, inability to experience interest or pleasure, and social withdrawal; and/or extreme agitation or slowing of movements, maintenance of unusual postures.\n",
            "People with schizophrenia often also experience persistent difficulties with their cognitive or thinking skills, such as memory, attention, and problem-solving.\n",
            "At least one third of people with schizophrenia experiences complete remission of symptoms (1).\n",
            "Some people with schizophrenia experience worsening and remission of symptoms periodically throughout their lives, others a gradual worsening of symptoms over time.\n",
            "Magnitude and impact Schizophrenia affects approximately 24 million people or 1 in 300 people (0.32%) worldwide.\n",
            "This rate is 1 in 222 people (0.45%) among adults (2).\n",
            "It is not as common as many other mental disorders.\n",
            "Onset is most often during late adolescence and the twenties, and onset tends to happen earlier among men than among women.\n",
            "Schizophrenia is frequently associated with significant distress and impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, and other important areas of life.\n",
            "People with schizophrenia are 2 to 3 times more likely to die early than the general population (3).\n",
            "This is often due to physical illnesses, such as cardiovascular, metabolic, and infectious diseases.\n",
            "People with schizophrenia often experience human rights violations both inside mental health institutions and in community settings.\n",
            "Stigma against people with this condition is intense and widespread, causing social exclusion, and impacting their relationships with others, including family and friends.\n",
            "This contributes to discrimination, which in turn can limit access to general health care, education, housing, and employment.\n",
            "During humanitarian and public health emergencies, extreme stress and fear, breakdown of social supports, isolation and disruption of health-care services and supply of medication can occur.\n",
            "These changes can have an impact on the lives of people with schizophrenia, such as exacerbation of existing symptoms.\n",
            "During emergencies, people with schizophrenia are more vulnerable than others to various human rights violations, including neglect, abandonment, homelessness, abuse and exclusion.\n",
            "Causes of schizophrenia Research has not identified one single cause of schizophrenia.\n",
